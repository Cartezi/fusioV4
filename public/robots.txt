# By default we disallow all crawler since Fusio is an API management system which provides an REST API. The apps in the
# apps/ folder are mostly for internal use. If you want to expose your developer portal to the public then it is
# recommended to create a dedicated sub-domain for the portal i.e. developer.acme.com
